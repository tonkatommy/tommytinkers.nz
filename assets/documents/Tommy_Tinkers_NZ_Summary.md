## 📜 Licensing & Intellectual Property

A licensing strategy was discussed for the Tommy Tinkers GitHub repository:

- **Branding** (logo, colours, design) — Protected / all rights reserved

The source code is available under the MIT License.
However, all content, images, branding, and design assets
